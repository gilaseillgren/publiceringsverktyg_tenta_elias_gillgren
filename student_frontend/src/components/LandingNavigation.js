        <p>
        My name is Elias Gillgren, I'm 22 years old and born in Lidk√∂ping, Sweden. But at the moment I live and play bandy in Motala.
        <br/><br/>
        I am employed by the IT company "Impleo IT Solution" in Motala as a graphic designer and tester, there I also make new layouts for mobile apps and computer applications.
        <br/><br/>
        I have always liked to create and invent all sorts of things. But it's in the digital medias I can express my ideas and creativity. I think it's really cool that you can affect a user with design! And that's the reason why I want to work as a webdesigner.
